    Instructions/ Objective
    ---------
    Level 1 displays the core mechanics that will be
    basis of all levels of the game. It is set on a
    desserted beach themed planet, Wachovia.
    
    The objective is to navigate your penguin player to the space
    ship which is on the right-most side of the screen.
    Along the way, there will be several obstacles.

    Collecting (i.e walking into) Skeleton Fish will decrease the player's health by 1/4 health points.
    Cakes will shoot donuts that will damage the player. Avoid both of these by
    jumping onto a platform or running away. Additionally, the player can run at the cake
    and destroy him.
    
    Alternatively, collecting the Green Fish will increase the player's health by 1/4 health points.
    
    The win situation occurs when the penguin reaches the ship and is taken to
    the 'End' screen for the level.
